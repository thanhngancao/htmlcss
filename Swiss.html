    <h2>The Culture Of Switzerland</h2>   

    <div id="flip1"><h3>People</h3></div>
    <div id="panel1">
        The culture of the small Alpine nation of Switzerland is heavily influenced by the cultures of its neighboring nations of France, Italy, and Germany. 
        This is evident in the fact that the major languages of these three countries, namely, French, Italian, and German serve as three of the four official languages of Switzerland (Romansh being the fourth one).
        The country also has 26 cantons, each with their distinct set of customs and traditions.
        <br>
        Switzerland is one of the richest nations in the world with most of the citizens enjoying a high standard of living in the country. 
        There is a large affluent middle class in the country. However, 80% of the private assets are owned by only 20% of the country’s richest people. 
        <br>
        The federal state of Switzerland has no state religion. The majority of the population of the country are Christians. 
        Most cantons of the country, however, recognize the Catholic Church or the Swiss Reformed Church. 
        Holidays and celebrations differ in the Swiss cantons. Christian holidays and festivals are celebrated with great pomp and glory in the nation. 
        The National Day, a secular holiday that is celebrated countrywide is observed on August 1.
